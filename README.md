# vodak32
Low cost, low power, continuous micro-still using ESP32 to manage fermentation and distillation. Suitable for solar, off-grid or mobile, powered "just in time" (JIT) do-it-yourself (DIY) spirits production.

Status: Design/Planning stage

Goal: Build a small "personal" still which can run on low power, off grid, solar systems without costing too much. An ideal would be requiring only 120W of power by utilizing a continuous steam injection process. An ESP32 has been chosen to control the various parts so that eventually it can just be self governing and let run as it will. It could either run "as the sun shines" with direct power or if large batteries are available then it could run more or even 24 hours/day, dependent on energy available.

Credits: This whole thing was inspired by the youtube channel "**tight**", which provide videos desscribing the fundamentals of the continuous process as implemented for a small still capable of non-stop operation producing around 1L/day 96% ethanol output. I have merely taken his technical info and massaged it into a small "package" prioritising low power and adding continuous fermentation stages.
